## Overview
  Deploy Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts
Get started deploying and interacting with smart contracts on Aztec. Create an aztec account,try one of our default contracts or upload your own and interact with public and private functions made possible by client-side ZK proofs created in your browser.

## Account Abstraction
Aztec's native account abstraction turns every account into a smart contract,enabling highly flexible and programmable user identities that unlock features like gas sponsorship,nonce abstraction (setting your own tx ordering),and the use of alternative signature schemes to control smart contracts with e.g. passkeys.

## Private Voting
Developers can seamlessly integrate public and private functions to unlock use cases like private voting. Voters can hide their address and cast their votes privately through a private function,which internally calls a public function to update the vote count transparently.

## Private Tokens
Accounts,transactions,and execution on Aztec can be done privately using client-side proofs,enabling you to private mint or transfer tokens,move public tokens into private domain or the reverse - transfer tokens from private to public,all without revealing your address or even the amount and recipient (in case of private transfer),all the while maintaining the total supply of tokens publicly.
